# EXERCISE 11: ASKING QUESTIONS

print "How old are you?"
age = gets.chomp
print "How tall are you?"
height = gets.chomp
print "How much do you weight?"
weight = gets.chomp

puts "So, you're #{age} old, #{height} tall and #{weight} heavy."

#use "print" instead of "puts" to print the string without \n (a new line) printed and the prompt stops right where the use should enter the answer.
